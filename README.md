## Features

Pressing the "GENERATE" button will generate a random image, a random color palette, and two random words.

The app fetches three types of data from external sources, such as APIs:

- for the image: https://picsum.photos/
- for the color palette: http://colormind.io/api/
- for words: https://random-word-api.vercel.app/api?words=2&type=capitalized
